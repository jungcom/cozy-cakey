# Update Contacts Section Background to Tertiary Color

## Analysis
- Current background: `bg-amber-800` (dark amber)
- Target background: tertiary color `#b37a7a` (defined in globals.css)
- Available utility class: `bg-tertiary`

## Todo Items

- [ ] Replace `bg-amber-800` with `bg-tertiary` in the contacts section
- [ ] Test the visual appearance to ensure readability
- [ ] Verify the change aligns with the overall design

## Implementation Notes
- Simple one-line change in src/components/MainPage/Contacts.tsx:5
- The tertiary color (#b37a7a) is a darker rose/mauve that should work well with the white text
- This change will make the contacts section consistent with the bakery's warm color scheme
