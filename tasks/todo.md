# Supabase Order Table Setup Plan

## Problem Analysis
The order form is fully implemented in the code, but the orders table doesn't exist in the Supabase database. The submit button is connected to form submission logic that tries to insert data into a non-existent table.

## Todo Items

### 1. Create orders table in Supabase
- [ ] Create the orders table with all required columns matching the OrderFormData interface
- [ ] Set up proper column types and constraints
- [ ] Add indexes for performance

### 2. Test the form submission
- [ ] Test the submit button functionality
- [ ] Verify data is properly saved to the database
- [ ] Check error handling works correctly

### 3. Review and verify
- [ ] Confirm the order form flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Test with sample data
- [ ] Verify price calculations are correct
