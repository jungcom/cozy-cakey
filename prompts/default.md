Based on the order table I have in supabase, I want to create a separate admin page for viewing the orders. The admin page should have the following features:

- View all orders
- Edit order details
- Delete order
- View order history

I want to use middleware to protect the admin page. This admin page should have a login page and once logged in, I will be able to see all the orders and be able to edit, delete, and view order history.
