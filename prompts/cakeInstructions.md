Instead of using the cake sizes constant to provide information, let's add the information within each cake object.

For design cakes objects, the sizes variable should be a hashmap of size in inches to price. The size in inches should be the key and the price should be the value. This applies the same to the flavor option and base color option as well.
Here is the data to populate the sizes variable for each design cake:
